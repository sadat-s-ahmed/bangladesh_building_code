TITLE, SCOPE AND GENERAL

1.1 TITLEBNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT

The provisions and regulations contained in this document shall constitute and be collectively known and may
be cited as the "Bangladesh National Building Code 2015", abbreviated, where desired, as BNBC, and will
hereinafter be referred to as the "Code".

1.2 PURPOSE

The purpose of this Code is to establish minimum standards for design, construction, quality of materials, use
and occupancy, location and maintenance of all buildings within Bangladesh in order to safeguard, within
achievable limits, life, limb, health, property and public welfare. The installation and use of certain equipment,
services and appurtenances related, connected or attached to such buildings are also regulated herein to
achieve the same purpose.

The provisions of this Code are applicable to all persons of Bangladesh irrespective of class, creed, culture,
religion or sex. The Code does not in any way create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or
group of persons who will or should be specially protected or benefited by the provisions of this Code.

The expressed intent of this Code is to ensure public safety, health and general welfare insofar as they are
affected by the construction, alteration, repair, removal, demolition, use or occupancy of buildings, structures or
premises, through structural strength, stability, means of egress, safety from fire and other hazards, sanitation,
light and ventilation.

1.3 SCOPE

The provisions of this Code shall apply to the design, construction, use or occupancy, alteration, moving,
demolition and repair of any building or structure and to any appurtenances installed therein or connected or
attached thereto, except such matters as are otherwise provided for in other ordinances and statutes
controlling and regulating buildings.

If for any case different sections of this Code provide different specifications for materials, methods of design or
construction, or other requirements, the most restrictive specification shall govern.

In case of any conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall
be applicable.

Unless otherwise explicitly stated in this Code, all references to part, chapter or section numbers or to
provisions not specifically identified by number, shall be construed to refer to such part, chapter, section or
provision of this Code.

#######NEWPAGE
,References made to a section without mentioning a part shall be construed to refer to that section of the part in
which the reference is made.

The provisions of any appendix in this Code shall not be mandatory unless they are referred to as such in any
section of the Code or they are specifically adopted by any regulation.

Part 1 1-1
Scope and Definition

BNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFTPart 1
Scope and Definition

Inspection conducted or permission granted for any building or plan of building, under the provisions of this
Code, shall not be construed as a warranty of the physical condition of such building or the adequacy of such
plan. Neither the Authority administering the Code, nor any employee thereof shall be liable for damages or any
defect or hazardous or illegal condition or inadequacy in such building or plan, nor for any failure of any
component of such building which may occur subsequent to such inspection or granting of permission under the
provisions of the Code.

1.4 EXISTING BUILDINGS

Buildings which are in existence on the date of promulgation of this Code may have their use or occupancy
continued without undergoing any alteration, abandonment or removal unless in the opinion of the Authority
such continued use is hazardous to life and property and provided such use or occupancy was legal on the date
of promulgation of this Code. Buildings approved before adoption of the present updated Code and compliant
with the previous version of the Code may continue to be used or occupied unless any deviation is made
thereafter or any deterioration has rendered the building unsafe in the opinion of the Authority.

1.4.1 Addition and Alteration

Additions, alterations, modifications or repair to an existing building may be made without requiring the existing
building to comply with all the requirements of this Code, provided the additions, alterations, modifications or
repairs conform to that required for a new building. Such additions or alterations shall not be permitted when
the existing building is not in full compliance with the provisions of this Code except when the addition or
alteration will result in the existing building or structure being no more hazardous based on life safety, fire
safety and sanitation than it was before the addition or alteration was undertaken.

Any building together with the new additions shall not exceed the height, number of storey’s and area specified
in this Code for new buildings having the relevant occupancy and type of construction. Non-structural
alterations or repairs to an existing building or structure which do not adversely affect any structural member,
nor reduce the strength of any part of the building or structure to result in an unsafe condition shall be made
with materials and components having the required fire resistance.

1.4.2 Change of Use

Change in use or occupancy in an existing building may be made when such change complies with the
requirements of this Code for a new building and provided such change does not render any part or the whole
of the affected building or structure any more hazardous based on life safety, fire safety and sanitation than it
was before such change was effected.

1.5 HISTORIC OR ARCHITECTURALLY VALUABLE BUILDINGS

#######NEWPAGE
,A building or structure which has been designated by official action as having special historical or archaeological
interest, or a building or structure identified by a legally constituted authority as being architecturally valuable,
may be undertaken for repairs, alterations and additions necessary for its preservation, restoration,
rehabilitation or continued use provided:

(a) the proposed repair, alteration or addition to buildings of historical or archaeological significance is
approved by the legally constituted authority, such as the Department of Archaeology;

(b) the proposed repair, alteration or addition to buildings of architectural value does not impair the
aesthetic quality and architectural character of such buildings; and

(c) the restored building or structure will be no more hazardous, if any, based on life safety, fire safety and
sanitation than the existing building.

** The occupancy classification for any project, not included in this list, shall be determined through the following
process:

i. The functional requirements of the unidentified occupancy shall be compared with the Occupancy use type,
classification,
sub classification categories and descriptions to match with the given occupancies to find the most similar
Occupancy,

ii. If process (i) fails to determine the Occupancy, the project will be referred to the Board of Appeal constituted as per
directives of Part 2 Chapter 2. The Board of Appeal shall determine the Occupancy, and

iii. The decision of Board of Appeal shall be considered as an explanatory material of this Code and shall be added as
addendum
to this Code. For any future projects of similar nature this addendum will suffice and need not be referred to the

CLASSIFICATION OF BUILDING
CONSTRUCTION TYPES BASED ON FIRE
RESISTANCE
3.1 GENERAL
3.1.1 Classification by Type of Construction
BNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT
For the purpose of this Code, every room or space of a building or a building itself hereafter altered or erected
shall be classified in one specific type of construction as grouped as follows:
GROUP I: Noncombustible, subdivision:
Type I-A: 4 hour fire protected
Type I-B: 3 hour fire protected
Type I-C: 2 hour fire protected
Type I-D: 1 hour fire protected
Type I-E: Unprotected
GROUP II: Combustible subdivision:
Type II-A: Heavy timber
Type II-B: Protected wood joist
Type II-C: Unprotected wood joist
Type II-D: Protected wood frame
Type II-E: Unprotected wood frame
The fire resistance ratings of various types of construction for structural and nonstructural members are
specified in Tables 3.3.1 (a) and (b). For hazardous Occupancies involving an exceptionally high degree of fire
risk or an exceptionally high concentration of combustible or flammable content, the Authority may increase the
requirement of Table 3.3.1 (a).
Buildings having a height of more than 33 m shall be constructed with noncombustible materials.

#######NEWPAGE
,The fire resistance ratings of various building components shall conform to ASTM standards.

No building or portion thereof shall be designated a given construction type unless it fully conforms to the
minimum requirements for that Construction type.

When a type of construction is utilized which is superior than the type of construction required by this Code,
there shall be no requirement to upgrade the rest of the construction to comply to that higher type of
construction and the designated construction type shall be that of the lesser classification, unless all of the
requirements for the higher classification are met.

General Building Requirements, Control and Regulation

3.1.2 Group I: Non-Combustible Construction

Buildings or portion thereof in Non-combustible Construction Group I are those in which the walls, exit-ways,
shafts, structural members, floors, and roofs are constructed of non-combustible materials and assemblies
having fire-resistance ratings specified in Table 3.3.1 (a). The Non-combustible group consists of Construction
Type I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D and I-E.

3.1.2.1 Construction Type I-A

This construction type includes buildings in which the bearing walls and other major structural elements are
generally of four-hour-fire-resistance rating.

3.1.2.2 Construction Type I-B

This construction type includes buildings in which the bearing walls and other major structural elements are
generally of three-hour-fire-resistance rating.

3.1.2.3 Construction Type I-C

This construction type includes buildings in which the bearing walls and other major structural elements are
generally of two-hour-fire-resistance rating.

3.1.2.4 Construction Type I-D

This construction type includes buildings in which the bearing walls and other major structural elements are
generally of one-hour-fire-resistance rating.

3.1.2.5 Construction Type I-E

This construction type includes buildings in which the bearing walls and other major structural elements
generally have no fire-resistance rating.

3.1.3 Group II: Combustible Construction

Buildings or portion thereof in Combustible Construction Group II are those in which the walls, exit-ways, shafts,

#######NEWPAGE
,structural members, floors, and roofs are constructed wholly or partly of combustible materials having fire-
resistance ratings specified in Table 3.3.1 (b). The Non-combustible group consists of Construction Type II-A, II-B,
II-C, II-D and II-E.

3.1.3.1 Construction Type II-A
This Construction type includes heavy timber construction in which fire-resistance is attained by-

(a) Limiting the minimum sizes of wood structural members and the minimum thickness and composition of
wood floors and roofs;

(b) Avoiding concealed spaces under floors and roofs or by providing fire-stopping protection for these
spaces; and

(c) Using fastening, construction details, and adhesives for structural members as required by this Chapter
and Part 4.

(d) The minimum dimensions for framing members shall be prescribed in this Chapter and Part 4, except that
members are protected to provide a fire-resistance rating of at least one hour need not comply with this
requirement.

3.1.3.2 Construction Type II-B
This Construction type includes buildings and portion thereof in which

(a) Exterior walls, fire walls, exit-ways, and shaft enclosures are of non-combustible materials having the
required fire-resistance ratings; and

(b) The floors, roofs and interior framing are wholly or partly of wood of smaller dimensions than required for
type II-A construction, or are of other combustible or non-combustible materials, having the required fire-
resistance rating.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY

4.1 SCOPE

The purpose of including this Chapter in the Code is to enhance the design and construction of buildings through
the use of building concepts having a positive environmental impact and encourage sustainable construction
practices, allowing efficiency and conservation of energy, water and building materials, and to promote
resource efficiency.

In addition to the clauses stipulated here, all Codes and standards relevant to a building occupancy as set forth
in other Sections of this Code will be applicable during implementation.

Design and drawings will be submitted to indicate the location, nature and scope of the proposed energy
efficient/sustainable feature. These shall indicate compliance to the provisions of this Code, and will be supplied
by the relevant design professionals, e.g. electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, plumbing engineers, etc.,
supporting architectural drawings.

4.1.1 Rationale for Sustainable/Green Buildings

Climate change is an established phenomenon affecting the environment globally and it is recognized that
buildings and the built environment play a vital role in the process, impacting on the natural environment and
the quality of life. Sustainable development concepts and approaches applied to the design, construction and
operation of buildings or to any built environment can enhance both the economic and environmental benefits
of the community in Bangladesh and around the world. Energy efficiency and sustainability is not an
individual issue rather an integrated and inseparable part of the building design and construction
process. The benefits of sustainable design principles include resource and energy efficiency, healthy buildings
and materials, ecologically and socially sensitive land use and strengthened local economics and the
communities, objectives vital for future development of Bangladesh.

Appendix A

Planning and Development Control

A.1 SCOPEBNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT

In absence of planning and zoning code in the national level, this Appendix states certain planning guidelines for
development control and for environmental and human safety. The guidelines formulated in this Appendix are
suggestive.

A.2 LAND USE CLASSIFICATION

Land is a finite resource. An integrated and hierarchical planning from national to local level of this resource is
essential to identify and use its potential in compliance with the National Land Use Policy.

Every city, township, municipality or other settlements shall have planning and zoning regulations administered
by the authority having jurisdiction to guide the existing and future developments of that settlement in
compliance with the National Land Use Policy and with local or regional master planning. Any land-use planning
shall clearly classify the following uses:

(a) Permitted land use

#######NEWPAGE
,(b) Conditionally permitted land-use and
(c) Restricted land use

Any such plan shall also include the preservation of open spaces and water bodies as part of the land use
planning.

A.3 GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR RESIDENTIAL DENSITY PLANNING

A.3.1 Control of residential density is a fundamental component of effective land use planning, as the relative
distribution of population has major implications for all other provisions. In determining Residential density, a
coherent view should be considered to achieve integrated land-use, transport, environmental and
infrastructural planning.

A.3.2 Along with this integrated approach, the following factors shall also guide the residential density:
(a) A hierarchy of residential densities should be maintained to ensure diversity of housing needs.
(b) Residential density of an area shall correspond to the capacity of existing and planned infrastructure
and environmental features of that area.
(c) Densities should be planned in such a way that encourage public transport and reduce travel demand.
(d) For large cities higher densities around stations and interchanges of rail based public transport system
may be encouraged to reduce reliance on road based public transport system.
(e) Since higher density residential development near high capacity transportation system creates pressure
on urban land use planning, careful environmental planning with definitive environmental objectives
shall be there for such instances.

Part 3 3-105
General Building Requirements, Control and Regulation

Part 3 BNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT
General Building Requirements, Control and Regulation

(f) To protect environmentally sensitive areas or areas of historical importance, a low density residential
development should be proposed where and as necessary.

(g) In heavily built up areas such as old towns, provision of Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) could be
implemented to control over-crowding.

A.3.3 The maximum allowable density of a residential development shall be guided by the Planning
Guidelines for a zone or area or locality or township which shall be prepared under and administered by the
authority having jurisdiction. Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for any development shall comply with any such planning
guidelines. Where such density guideline is not available, the maximum allowable density for a residential
development shall be 175 units per hectare.

A.4 GENERAL PLANNING GUIDELINES FOR OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS

In a high density context like ours, pressure on land is extreme. Preserving open spaces and maintaining
environmental balance become a priority in this context. In any planning process, open space must be planned
as a land use in its own right and not as the remainder after providing other land uses. The hierarchy of
Recreational open spaces in planning settlements may be as following:

(a) Local Open Space

(b) Ward Open Space

#######NEWPAGE
,(c) Regional Open Space

Authorities having jurisdiction shall determine the extent of the terms ‘local’, ‘ward’ and ‘region’ on the basis of
governance structure and the master planning for any particular area. However, in developing any area layout
as specified in Sec A.5.2 of this Appendix, provisions for Local open space should be applicable. All open spaces
in this hierarchy should act as a connected component of an open space network. The following paragraphs
indicate few guidelines on location and space requirements for such open spaces.

A.4.1 Every locality should have Local Open Space which is required to meet primarily the passive recreational
needs (e.g. outdoor sitting, jogging/ walking tracks, playgrounds for children etc.) of the population. Such spaces
should be located either within the residential neighborhood or somewhere centrally to serve a wider area of
more than one neighborhood. Considering the projected future population of a locality, a minimum
requirement of 1 m² of Local open space per locality occupant should be allotted. Where possible such open
spaces should be at least 500 m².

A.4.2 Every ward in a city or town or union should have Ward Open Space which is required to meet the
active recreational needs (e.g. standard facilities for sports) and passive recreational needs of the ward
population. Considering the projected future population of a Ward, a minimum requirement of 1 m² Ward Open
Space per Ward occupant should be allotted. Where possible such open spaces should be at least 10,000 m² (1
hectare).

A.4.3 Every region should have Regional Open Space which is required to meet wider recreational needs of
the population that cannot be served by local or ward open spaces. In metropolitan areas, Ward Open Space
may supplement for 50 percent of the Regional Open Space requirement. Conscious planning effort are needed
to create/ designate and/ or preserve 'Regional Open Spaces' located close to major public transport routes,
taking advantage of natural landscape, waterfront, hill views, forest areas and/or views to special features that
may draw visitors from all around. Where possible such open spaces should be at least 50,000 m² (5 hectare).

Planning and Development Control Appendix A

A.5 COMMUNITY OPEN SPACE AND AMENITIES

Every plot as specified in Sections A.5.1 and A.5.2 shall have community open space which is required to meet
primarily the passive recreational needs (e.g. outdoor sitting, jogging/walking tracks, playgrounds for children
etc.) of the population. Such spaces shall be located within the plot boundary. Considering the types of
development, the following minimum requirements of community open space and amenities shall be applicable
as per guideline of Sections A.5.1 and A.5.2 of this Appendix.

A.5.1 Community Space for a Single Tall Building or Group of Buildings In a Plot

For all residential or residential-cum-business buildings having ten or more storeys, or for all plots on which
more than one residential or residential-cum-business buildings are constructed, community built space at the
rate of 5 percent of the total floor area shall be provided within the building for use of the occupants of the
building solely. Roofs of such buildings shall not be considered as community open spaces.

For residential or residential-cum-business plots measuring more than 0.1 hectare, 10 percent of the area of
land or 1 m² per occupant of the plot, whichever is larger, shall be left vacant to be used as children's
playground. This playground shall be contiguous and shall have a length not exceeding 2.5 times its width. The
playground may extend into the mandatory open space of the plot.

#######NEWPAGE
,Open space and amenities for residential or residential-cum-business plots measuring more than 0.4 hectare
shall be as per guidelines of Sec A.5.2 of this Chapter.

A.5.2 Community Open Space and Amenities in Area Layouts

(a) Residential or Business Areas

In dividing any land measuring a total of 0.4 hectares or more into residential or business plots,
community open spaces and amenities shall be reserved for recreational, educational, health care and
other purposes depending on the size of the population for which the layout is planned. For planning
such open spaces and amenities the guidelines of Sec A.4 of this Appendix and Sec B.3 of Appendix B
shall be applicable.

(b) Industrial Areas

In dividing any land measuring a total of 1 hectare or more into industrial plots, 5 percent of the total
land area shall be reserved as amenity open space which shall be used as lawn, park or garden. The
minimum size of such open space shall be 600 m². When the area of the open space exceeds 1000 m²,
the area of land in excess of 1000 m² can be used for the construction of buildings for banks, clinics,
welfare centers and other common facilities for use of the persons working in the industries.

Guidelines for Minimum Standard Housing
Development
B.1 GENERALBNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT

#######NEWPAGE
,B.1.1 Government bodies or public agencies may designate an area in the master plan for the development of
Mass Housing Projects. Generally all such development shall be known as Minimum Standard Housing, which
shall be broadly categorized into the following two categories: a) Minimum Standard Community Housing and
b) Minimum Standard Transitional Housing. Requirements for master plan and dwelling units in such projects
shall have special provisions depending upon the category of development mentioned above.

The guidelines of this Appendix cover the planning and the general building requirements of all such Minimum
Standard Housing developments.

B.1.2 A minimum standard community housing is a housing that confirms to the basic minimum requirement
regarding dwelling units, community and other facilities according to the provision of this Code. Requirements
for community facilities in these housings shall depend upon the size and scale of the community (Sec B.4.2).
Dwelling units in all such developments shall be classified as Occupancy A1, A2, A3 or Mixed Occupancy
depending upon the type of development (Sec B.3) and degree of mixing with other occupancies within the
same structure.

B.1.3 Minimum Standard Transitional Housings are housing facilities on a transient basis before providing its
inhabitants with Minimum Standard Community Housing. Ensuring safety, health and sanitation requirements
shall be the primary obligation for such housing. Since, it may not be convenient or practicable for the planning
and dwelling units in such projects to be in full compliance with all the requirements of this Code, a few
exemptions have been made for all such housings in the following Sections of this Appendix. All Transitional
Housing, irrespective of its type of development (Sec B.2) shall be group housing. Dwelling units in a transitional
housing shall be classified as Occupancy A3, A4 or Mixed Occupancy depending upon the type of development
and degree of mixing with other occupancies within the same structure.

B.1.4 Only government bodies or public agencies should be responsible for planning the number and location
of the settlements in an approved master plan following the density guidelines of Appendix A and the layout of
units within the settlement. The guidelines of this Appendix regarding layout planning are applicable to
government bodies or public agencies responsible for such planning.

B.1.5 The guidelines and requirements regarding design and construction of buildings for minimum standard
housing in approved layouts are applicable to all government bodies, public agencies, private developers or
individual owners who undertake such constructions.

B.2 TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT

The development of minimum standard housing may be any one or a combination of the following types:

(a) Single unit plots of row type housing

(b) Multi-storied flats of row type housing

(e) Site and service schemes

#######NEWPAGE
,The guidelines for planning and general building requirements shall be applicable to all types of development of
minimum standard housing unless exempted as mentioned in this Appendix.

B.2.1 Single Unit Plots of Row Type Housing

Row Type in a housing development is characterized by independent plotted developments for single family
dwelling (A1) and shared community facilities. Along with single family detached and semi-detached dwelling,
this type of dwelling is used to achieve low-densities in a settlement.

This type of development should be located away from high capacity public transportation system and should
be characterized by high car ownership rate.

All such development shall comply with the provisions for parti-wall and general criteria for natural lighting and
ventilation as described in Part 3 Chapter 1, Part 6 and Appendix E.

BNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT
Figure 3.B.1 Row type development

B.2.2 Multi-Storied Flats of Row Type Housing

Unlike single unit plots of row type development multistoried flats of row type housing are not plotted
development. Here the un-demarcated un-divided land is shared by the flat owners within such complex.

Houses or flats or apartments in Multi-storied Row type developments shall share walls with adjacent flat or
apartment, provided that they are designed and built at the same period as part of the same project and also
that they fulfill the general criteria for natural lighting and ventilation as referred in Part 3, Chapter 1.

Multi-storied row type developments should be permitted for walkup apartments (A3) as well as two family
dwelling (A2) with many of the community facilities at lower levels. Such developments are good for medium
density settlements and may also be used in mixed use zones.

B.2.3 Block Development as a Group Housing

Block developments are characterized by high-density large scale developments within a block usually
surrounded by roads all around and serviced by high capacity transport and utility network.

Large plots of 4048 m² or more, with road access on one side may also be considered as block development if
provided with a peripheral access road along its perimeter and also if they are in close proximity to high capacity
transport and utility infrastructure network. All such plots may be allowed to attain higher densities than other

Guidelines for Minimum Standard Housing Development Appendix B

typologies. Such developments are more desirable in the central urban areas emphasizing more dependency on
public transportation and less on private transportation. Parking requirements in such typologies shall be less
than other typologies.

Block development for Group Housing should be permitted for large scale developments of Apartments (A3) or
Mess, Boarding houses, Dormitories and Hostel (A4).

#######NEWPAGE
,All such residential developments can be mixed with other permitted occupancies to encourage availability of all
services within the close proximity and to support growth of local economy. All such developments can be
subdivided into following two categories:

(a) Tower Block Development for Group Housing

This includes Flats or Apartments (A3) in a single or multiple high-rise towers within a block/large site with
relatively low ground coverage and higher density along with open spaces and community facilities within
and around the tower blocks.

BNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT
Figure 3.B.2 Tower block development

(b) Perimeter Block Development for Group Housing

Unlike Tower blocks, Perimeter block developments involves one single building or multiple buildings placed
along the perimeter of the site to create an internal open space shielded from its surrounding, commonly
used as community space. Each housing unit in such developments shall have at least two sides open- one
at the internal open space and the other at the external road side.

Depending upon the plot size and population such development may also be permitted to become high-rise
development, provided that the internal open space in such development confirms to the criteria for
minimum requirements of a courtyard (Part 3, Chapter 1).

B.2.4 Cluster Housing

Cluster type development, as a housing form, is suitable for accommodating low to high density of population
within walkup range. Cluster type development for Group Housing should be permitted for all ranges such as for
low density development for single family dwelling (A1) and two family dwelling (A2) or for moderate to high
density developments of Apartments (A3) or Mess, Boarding houses, Dormitories and Hostel (A4). Details of this
typology have been discussed in Appendix D.

B.2.5 Site and Service Schemes

Site and service schemes shall delineate individual plots and provide for the infrastructural needs for the
development of a permanent housing. Interim constructions by the allottees should also be permitted. Skeletal
structures with a roof on columns and/or developed plinths may be provided if funds are available.

Bangladesh National Building Code 2015 3-113

Part 3
General Building Requirements, Control and Regulation

Sanitation and water supply must be provided in all site and service schemes. A sanitary service core or common
water supply and sanitation facilities for planned groups of plots should normally suffice. The developing agency
shall install the services before handing over the plots.
Site and service schemes for group housing should be permitted for low density development of single family
dwelling (A1) and two family dwelling (A2) and ownership right of such housing shall be non-transferrable.

B.3 PLANNING

B.3.1 A minimum standard housing shall ensure quality living for all its inhabitants. Providing proper
environmental quality, social and utility infrastructure, educational facilities, health care and recreational
facilities, connectivity to commerce and job locations in a comprehensive planning are pre-conditions to attain
that. With increasing urban population and the shortage of developable land, high residential densities shall
occur. This multiplies the necessity for the provision of community facilities to ensure the minimum standard of
the housing.

3-114 Vol. 1

Guidelines for Minimum Standard Housing Development Appendix B

B.3.2 DensityBNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT

Housing density for an area or locality or settlement is a planning issue and shall be decided by the planning
authority in accordance with the Detail Area Plan (DAP). Where such guidelines are unavailable, the gross
density of a minimum standard housing shall not be more than 175 units per hectare, considering an average
population of 5 persons per dwelling unit. The general distribution of built area and open space shall follow the
provisions of Sec B.3.3.

B.3.3 Basic Requirements for Community Facilities and Facilities for Locality

Any minimum standard housing, irrespective of its type of development, should be planned and organized in
groups or clusters, where each of the clusters should not exceed 400 dwelling units with an average population
of 5 residents per dwelling. Where the number of dwellings is more than that, more than one clusters, each
below 400 units, should be formed.

In any housing project, community and facilities for locality are essential. The facilities required for any such
project shall depend on the size of the community or communities within a locality. Table 3.B.1 and Table 3.B.2
show the requirements of such facilities for any housing development in reference to their variation of net
density and their relation to the threshold population.

B.3.3.1 Open space within a site area

Open space within a site area shall be as defined in Sec 1.8 Chapter 1, Part 3. However for a minimum standard
housing, such open space shall also be equal or more than the open to sky space which is an outcome of
addition of

(a) Mandatory setback area and
(b) Area requirement for Community Open Space (COS) as per Sec B.3.3.2.

For plots below 4048 m² community open space may overlap with mandatory setback area.

B.3.3.2 Community open space shall not be less than 1 m² per occupant.

B.3.3.3 Community facilities consist of two components:

(a) Community Open Space (COS): Community open space is an undivided contiguous open space within a plot
or block or cluster which along with mandatory setback area constitutes the open space of the site.

#######NEWPAGE
,Depending upon the size of population and land area this space may be used as any or combination of the
following uses-

(i) Lawn

(ii) Garden

(iii) Play lot

All such uses shall be exclusive to the residents of that plot or block or cluster.

No paved area, other than the minimum required area for vehicular and pedestrian access to the site, is
allowed within this community open space. All such road and walkways shall ensure pedestrian priority and
safety and shall not be used as a through circulation.

The following guidelines shall be maintained if the area of the community open space within the site fulfills
the criteria mentioned in the first column of Table 3.B.1.

(b) Community Built Space (CBS): Community built space is part of the community facilities dedicated to serve
the population within a given site or block or cluster. Depending upon the threshold population, the CBS
shall include facilities as per guideline of Table 3.B.2 for a threshold population up to 200 families.

Table 3.B.1: Guideline for Minimum Width for Community Open Space

B.3.3.4 Facilities for Locality (FL): Facilities for localities are shared facilities consisting of both Local Open
Spaces (LOS) and Local Built Spaces (LBS) located outside the plot boundary but within the locality. The total
space requirement of the Facilities for locality shall vary considerably depending upon the requirements of net
density, gross density and threshold population of Table 3.B.2.

Table 3.B.2 refers to list of such facilities for a plot/locality/ward/region in relation to population size and space
requirement for a settlement.

D.29 TACTILE GROUND SURFACE INDICATORS

D.29.1 Path of Travel and Mobility

People with different forms of visual impairments can be assisted to find their way independently with the help
of some physical or sensory cues e.g. landmarks and mind maps. For such users a predictable, logical and barrier
free access route is required. Therefore all such path of travel dedicated to universal accessibility should be
designed as free from barriers, hazards or obstructions along with physical and sensory cues for such users.

D.29.2 Physical Cues

Physical cues are designed elements including buildings, walls, ground surfaces, railings, fences and curbs that
can act as cues or clues to assist a visually impaired person. Such persons can identify physical cues either by use
of a white cane, under foot, or by echo-location. All public buildings referred in Sec D.3 shall have physical cue
both inside and outside the building to assist visually impaired persons.

Tactile ground indicators are designed physical cue to convey two important indications to visually impaired
persons- a. directional indications and b. caution or warning indications.

Directional indicators, Figure 3.D.43, act as physical cues to guide persons with visual impairment to travel
through an accessible route free from obstructions from beginning to end.

attached type, detached type, semi-detached type etc. regarding their development rights and rights regarding
building on abutting property lines. These requirements are applicable to all occupancy types taken up by
public, private or co-operative agencies.

E.2 DEFINITION AND TYPOLOGY

The following are some definitions and diagrams to explain different typologies and terminologies relevant to
this Code:
E.2.1 Row Type Building
A row type building abuts two side plot party-lines and is one of a row of buildings on adjoining zoning lots. The
end buildings of a row of attached buildings are considered semi-detached buildings if they each have minimum
side setback. Here the rest two (non-abutting) sides of the building are surrounded by yards or open areas
within the plot confirming at least to minimum setback requirements (Figure 3.E.1).
E.2.2 Semi-detached Building
A semi-detached building is a building that abuts one side on the party-line of a plot and does not abut any
other building on any other side of any adjoining plot/s; here the rest three (non-abutting) sides of the building

Road Hierarchy, On-Street and Off-Street
Parking

F.1 INTRODUCTION

Road is an integral part of a settlement and its land-use planning. For public safety in any new development the
hierarchy of road network with measures for gradual traffic calming and adequate safe parking, both on-street
and off-street, are of vital importance. Road width and road components, junctions, features of controlling
vehicles’ speed and turning, forward visibility and visibility splay at junctions are important tools of traffic and
speed control.

With increased density and parking demand, on-street parking shall be an important tool to increase overall
parking capacity as well as accommodation for service vehicles (e.g. garbage collection vehicle, maintenance
vehicles etc.). This measure is also expected to keep the pedestrian walkways free from unauthorized vehicular
parking.

F.3 ROAD HIERARCHY GUIDELINES FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT

For any new development, at least three hierarchically interlinked road patterns should be followed (Figure
3.F.1): a. primary road, b. secondary road and c. internal/ access/ residential road. Though it is not mandatory to
provide wider than regulation pedestrian walkways (with provisions for street furniture), bi-cycle lane and
plantation zones parallel to walkways, it is strongly recommended that such provisions should be made,
especially at primary and secondary road level, as much as possible.

Primary Road: This refers to a Public way or portion thereof, on which vehicular traffic is given preferential
right-of-way, and at the entrance to which from intersecting public ways is required to be in obedience to a
traffic signal, stop sign, or yield sign as per traffic code. Primary roads connect settlements/ zones/ sectors with
rest of the city, which are capable of and usually are serviced by public transport facility (e.g. Bus service, Tram
service etc.). These roads define the edge of the settlement and shall be capable of hosting traffic interchange
(e.g. changing from one mode of transport to another). No individual plot should be accessed directly from a
primary road (Figure 3.F.2). The right of way of a primary road shall not be less than 18 meter (Table 3.F.1 and
Figure 3.F.3).
BNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT

Figure 3.F.1 Road hierarchy

Secondary Road: A secondary Road is a collector road or distributor road of low to moderate-capacity, which
serve to move traffic from internal/ local streets to primary/arterial road. The flow of a collector road usually
consists of a mixture of signaled intersections or traffic circles with primary arterial roads or other collector
roads and un-signaled intersection with local/ internal/ residential roads.

A secondary road shall not be less than 13.5 m (Table 3.F.1 and Figure 3.F.4).

Internal/access/residential road: At the bottom of the hierarchy are local/Internal/access streets and roads.
These roads have the lowest speed limit, carry low volumes of traffic and often have pedestrian priority. The
minimum width of such road will depend on the density of the adjacent plots (Table 3.F.1, Figure 3.F.5).

Bangladesh National Building Code 2015 3-163

Part 3
General Building Requirements, Control and Regulation

F.5.1 Parking along Primary Road

For primary roads, fast moving uninterrupted traffic flow needs to be ensured. Therefore such roads shall not
serve for on-street parking. If, parking besides such primary roads becomes necessary, then an additional
carriageway with on-street parking and an additional pedestrian walkway as shown in Figure 3.F.6 may be
planned, keeping the main traffic flow uninterrupted.

F.5.2 Parking along Non-Primary Roads

On-street parking should normally only be considered on local distributors and roads lower in the hierarchy. On
such roads, on-street parking spaces may be provided where off-street facilities are inadequate to meet
demand and where provision would not adversely affect the flow of traffic. On-street spaces should generally
cater for short term parking needs and parking meters may be installed to encourage such usage.
F.5.3 Parking for Service Vehicles

In most situations, it will not be necessary to provide parking spaces specifically for service vehicles, such as
delivery vans, which are normally stationary for a relatively short time. If such parking bays are considered
necessary, other vehicles may need to be prevented from using the spaces by regulation and enforcement.
F.5.4 Omission and Conversion of Existing Parking

Omission and conversion of existing parking spaces shall not be permitted if it results in parking deficiency for

#######NEWPAGE
,the occupancy type. That is, after omission and conversion, the remaining number of parking spaces must be
sufficient to meet the minimum requirement of the existing, proposed and approved development.
F.5.5 Parking Design Considerations
Any parking space design will consider the following two factors:

(a) Minimum parking requirement ascertained for each type of occupancy
(b) Parking layout for the required number of parking (Figures 3.5.7 to 3.F.13)

F.10 PROVISIONS FOR CAR LIFT AND MECHANIZED PARKING

F.10.1 General

To connect between different levels with vehicular access, car lifts can be used instead of a carriageway ramps.
However, where a site is so constrained that it is not technically feasible to place a conventional ramp to
connect between levels, mechanized parking may be installed. All such parking shall require queuing space as
per provisions of this Code.

F.10.2 Guidelines for car lifts in a parking

A car lift shall have two openings, allowing entry of a car from one direction and exit of the car to the opposite
direction. After entry to a facility or a building having car lifts, a minimum queuing space for at least 15 percent
of the total parking shall be provided within the site. On departure from site, at least one holding bay having
equal space of a parking stall shall be provided within the site (Figures 3.F.12 and 3.F.13).

The internal dimension of all such lifts shall not be less than 2600 mm x 6200 mm with a minimum discharge
capacity of 30 vehicles per hour. For every 50 vehicles 1 car lift shall be installed. To reduce queue at least two
lifts shall be installed in a facility or a building. Maximum number of parking using car lifts shall not exceed 200.

F.10.3 Guidelines for Mechanized Parking

A mechanized parking may involve stacking system or lateral displacement system or a combination of both.
The approach driveway width for a mechanized parking shall be at least 3.6 meter for one-way traffic and 6.0
meter for two-way traffic. After entry to a facility or a building having mechanized parking, a minimum queuing
space for at least 5 percent of the total parking shall be provided within the site.

Mechanized parking varies widely in type and specification; and shall be installed according to its
manufacturer’s specifications. In doing so and during its operation it shall not compromise the safety of the
building or the users in any way.

entry to another separated area of a building shall be termed as exit access. Straight line distance between
the remotest point of an area of incident and the entrance point of a separated area shall be measured and
termed as a travel distance.

(b) The exit is a component or a group of components start with a protected opening to evacuate an area of
fire incidence and provides a safe entry to a separated area which is component of means of egress and
subsequently leads to the exit discharge.

(c) The outer edges or peripheral points of a building from where occupants shall evacuate the building
envelope termed as Exit discharges which shall lead evacuees to the terminal points at a safe distance from
thereof.

An area or any plot abutting street which is open to air and designated for systematic assemblies of evacuees to
complete the process of egress system shall be termed as exit termination.

3.2.2 The parts of the means of egress consist of any of the following exit components:

(a) A doorway, separated or refuge area like smoke and fire proof enclosure, compartment, corridor, passage,
ramp, balcony, an exterior or open or interior fire stair, or any combination of these, leads orderly to the
exit discharge which offer safety from fire or smoke from the area of incidence.

(b) Horizontal exit shall provide a delayed egress by relocating the occupants from their initial location due to a
fire incident to a separated area at same level of a same building or at the same level of adjoining or
detached buildings connected through a fire door or a vestibule or a passage or corridors for relocation of
evacuees. Receiving areas are capable to accommodate expected evacuees for certain time period, free

The three principles of extinguishments are employed, namely emulsification, cooling and dilution. While the
water droplets are passing through the flame zone, some of the water is turned into steam, diluting the oxygen
feeding the fire. Addition of water to the burning oil also cools it and reduces the rate of vaporization. In
addition to this droplets of water traveling at high velocity bombard the surface of the oil to form an emulsion
of oil and water that will not support combustion.

4.2.7 Water Mist Technology

Fine water spray suppression system can extinguish fires using water and nitrogen from air. Nozzle is used to
atomize water by nitrogen or other suitable media to generate mist or fog of finely controlled water droplets.
The system operates at low pressure and produces droplets in a range of 80 to 200 microns. These droplets
extinguish fire rapidly and efficiently even those involving highly volatile hydrocarbons. This system is an
alternative to Halon and other gaseous system in many applications.

4.2.8 Drenchers

Drenchers are used for the external protection of the building against exposure hazard, or radiant heat.
Drencher heads are similar to sprinkler heads and may be sealed or unsealed. Drenchers are of three types, roof
drenchers, wall drenchers, window drenchers.

4.2.9 Dry Riser System

Dry riser stand pipe system shall be an equivalent alternative of wet riser stand pipe system. The water supply
for an automatic or semi-automatic standpipe system shall be designed such that the system must be capable of
supply the system during peak demand hour.

Fire Protection Considerations for Venting in
Industrial and Storage Buildings

B.1 SCOPE BNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT

B.1.1 This Appendix covers venting requirements in industrial buildings. Provisions contained herein shall be
applicable to factory and storage facilities requiring large floor areas without dividing walls and enclosures.

B.1.2 This Appendix shall not apply to ventilation designed for personnel comfort, commercial cooking
operation, regulating odor or humidity in toilet and bathing facilities, to regulate cooling equipment.

B.1.3 This Appendix shall apply to fire and smoke of two criteria: (a) Fire or smoke layer that does not
enhance the burning rate and (b) Deflagration.

B.2 VENTING OF FIRE AND SMOKE THAT DOES NOT ENHANCE THE BURNING RATE

B.2.1 Determination of precise venting requirements is difficult, as variables like rate of combustion,
composition of the combustion product, shape, size and packaging of the combustible materials as well the size,
height and disposition of the stacks of materials are involved with it.

B.2.2 Vent system designs shall be computed by calculating the vent area required to achieve a mass rate of
flow through the vent that equals the mass rate of smoke production.

B.2.3 Venting devices are to be so designed and installed that they operate automatically at the earliest sign
of fire or smoke.

B.2.4 The smoke and fire venting system shall be so designed and installed as to keep the temperature of the
combustion product as low as possible, preferably below 150oC.

B.2.5 To achieve full efficiency in vents total area of all vents must be more than the inlet area for cold air.
Ideally the inlets should be as close to the ground as possible.
B.2.6 The area of unit vent shall not exceed 2d2, where d is the design depth of the smoke layer. For vents
with length to width ratio more than two, the width shall not exceed the design depth of the smoke layer.

B.2.7 The center-to-center spacing of vents within a curtained area shall not exceed 2.8 H, where H is the
ceiling height. For different shape of the roof the ceiling height can be calculated as per provision of NFPA 204.

B.2.8 The spacing of vents shall be such that the horizontal distance from any point on a wall or draft curtain
to the center of the nearest vent, within a curtained area does not exceed 1.4 H.

B.2.9 The total vent area per curtained area shall be sized to meet the design objectives and the performance
objectives relative to the design fire or smoke, determined in accordance with NFPA 204.

B.2.10 The design of venting for sprinkled building shall be based on performance analysis acceptable to the
authority having jurisdiction, demonstrating that the established objectives are met.

#######NEWPAGE
,BNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFTPart 4
Fire Protection

B.2.11 Smoke and heat venting systems and mechanical exhaust systems shall be inspected and maintained in
accordance with NFPA 204.

B.2.12 Venting systems are complement to fire extinguishing system. Where automatic sprinklers are installed
as fire extinguishing system, the sprinklers shall operate before the vent system comes into operation.

B.2.13 In industrial buildings exterior wall windows alone shall not be accepted as satisfactory means of
venting, but may be reckoned as additional means of venting when located close to the eaves and are provided
with ordinary glass or movable section arranged for both manual and automatic operation.

B.2.14 Vents shall be automatic in operation unless where designed specifically for both manual and automatic
operation.

B.2.15 Release mechanism of vent closure shall be simple in operation and shall not be dependent on electric
power.

B.2.16 The automatic operation of vents can be achieved by actuation of fusible links or other heat or smoke
detectors or by interlacing with the operation of sprinkler system or any other automatic fire extinguishing
system covering the area. The vents can be so designed as to open by counterweights utilizing the force of
gravity or spring loaded level following its release.

B.2.17 When vents and automatic sprinklers where installed together, sprinkler shall go into operation first
before vents open, in order to avoid delay in sprinkler operation.

B.2.18 Materials used in hinges, hatches and other related parts in vents shall be noncorrosive in nature for
long trouble free operation.

B.2.19 Vents shall be properly sited, at the highest point in each area to be covered.

B.2.20 If possible, vents shall be sited right on top of the probable risk area to be protected to ensure free and
speedy removal of smoke and other combustion product.

B.2.21 Minimum vent opening shall not be less than 1250 mm in any direction.

B.2.22 Vent spacing shall be designed considering the fact that higher number of smaller vents is better than
smaller number of large vents.

B.3 DEFLAGRATION VENTING

B.3.1 Deflagration is the propagation of a fire or smoke at a velocity less than the sound wave. When this
velocity of combustion increased beyond sound velocity then the combustion is said to be detonated and
explosion occurred with the rupture of an enclosure or a container due to the increase of internal pressure from
a deflagration.

B.3.2 The design of deflagration vents and vents closures necessitates consideration of many variables, only
some of which have been investigated in depth. No Venting recommendations are currently available for fast-
burning gases with fundamental burning velocities greater than 1.3 times that of propane, such as hydrogen.
Recommendations are unavailable and no venting data have been generated that addresses condition that fast-
burning gas deflagrations. The user is cautioned that fast-burning gas deflagrations can readily undergo
transition to detonation.

#######NEWPAGE
,B.3.3 Deflagration venting is provided for enclosures to minimize structural damage to the enclosure itself
and to reduce the probability of damage to the other structures.

B.3.4 Venting shall be sufficient to prevent the maximum pressure that develops within the enclosure from
exceeding enclosure strength.

4-64 Vol. 1

Fire Protection Considerations for Venting in Industrial and Storage Buildings Appendix B

B.3.5 The vent area shall be distributed as symmetrically and as evenly as possible.BNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT

B.3.6 The need for deflagration vents can be eliminated by the application of explosion prevention
techniques described in NFPA 69.

B.3.7 The vent closure shall be designed to function as rapid as is practical. The mass of the closure shall be as
low as possible to reduce the effects of inertia. The total mass of the moveable part of the vent closure
assembly shall not be exceeded 12.2 kg/m2.

B.3.8 When an enclosure is subdivided into compartments by walls, partitions, floors, or ceilings, then each
compartment that contains a deflagration hazard should be provided with its own vent closure(s).

B.3.9 It is possible to isolate hazardous operations and equipment outside of buildings with a pressure
resisting wall which will reduce risk of structural damage. Such operations and equipment may be housed in a
single storey building having appropriate venting facilities and a device to absorb explosion shock from blowing
through the duct back to the building.

B.3.10 Sometimes it may not be possible to house hazardous operations and equipment outside of the
building, in which case the separation from other parts and equipment shall be achieved by pressure resisting
walls and such units shall be ventilated outdoors. If suitable vents are integrated, external walls may be of heavy
construction or of heavy panel which may be blown off easily.

B.3.11 Unobstructed vent opening is the most effective pressure release vent structures.

B.3.12 Explosion relief vents may be provided with open or unobstructed vents, louvers, roof vents, hanger
type doors, building doors, windows, roof or wall panels or marble/fixed sash. Any or more than one of these
may be adopted depending on individual situations and requirements.

B.3.13 Roof vents covered with weather hoods shall be as light as possible and attached lightly, so that it is
easily blown off as and when an explosion occurs.

B.3.14 Doors and windows used as explosion vents shall be so fixed as to open outward. Doors shall be fitted
with friction, spring or magnetic, latches that function automatically at the slight increase in internal pressure.

B.3.15 Placed at the top or bottom, the hinged or projected movable sash shall be equipped with latch or
friction device to prevent accidental opening due to wind action or intrusion. Such latches or locks shall be well
maintained.

B.3.16 Venting shall be so planned as to prevent injury to inmates and damage to enclosure. In populated
locations, substantial ducts or diverts shall be provided to channelize the blast towards a pre-determined
direction.

#######NEWPAGE
,B.3.17 If explosion are probable within the duct, they shall be equipped with diaphragm to rupture at
predetermined locations. The duct system shall not be physically connected to more than one collector.

B.3.18 Skylight with moveable sash that opens outward or fixed sash having panes of glass or plastic that blow
out readily under pressure from within can be used to supplement wall vents or windows, provided their
resistance to opening or displacement may be kept as low as possible consistent with structural requirement of
the building.

B.3.19 For equivalent explosion pressure release, larger closed vents will be required compared to open vents.

B.3.20 As far as possible hazardous areas shall be segregated be means of fire walls or party walls to prevent
spread of fire.

Appendix C

Selection and Sitting of Fire Detection System

C.1 GENERAL BNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFT

This Appendix provides information for selection and sitting of equipment for fire detection in buildings.

C.2 CHOICE OF FIRE DETECTORS

Fire detectors may respond to any one manifestation of combustions such as heat generation, smoke and
flames.

Smoke detectors are not naturally suitable in places where the production process produces smokes.

Application of flame detectors are restricted due to the fact that all combustions do not necessarily accompany
flame and that clear line of sight is desirable as radiation from flames travel in straight lines for actuation of
sensitive element.

No single detector is able to meet the need of all types of fires and all types of occupancies. As such, based on
needs arising out of various situations and occupancies, judicious selection is extremely important for the
reduction of fire hazards.

C.2.1 Heat Detectors

"Point" or "Spot" type detectors are actuated by heat at layer adjacent to it over a limited area. "Line" type
detectors are sensitive to the effect produced by heated gas along any portion of the detector line. Both the
types operate on two broad principles: one, the heat sensitive elements is actuated by temperature rising
beyond a predetermined level; while the second system is actuated by predetermined rate of rise of

#######NEWPAGE
,temperature.

C.2.2 Flame Detectors

Flame detectors are sensitive to radiation emitted by flames. Since heat, smoke and flame are produced during
a fire, detectors responding to all these are accepted as general purpose detectors.

Fixed temperature heat detectors are suitable for use where ambient temperatures are high and or may rise
and fall rapidly over a short period.

C.2.3 Rate of Rise Heat Detectors

These are suitable for use where ambient temperatures are low and/or may rise over a wide range slowly.
Abnormally sharp rise in temperature during a fire actuates this alarm. As such it cannot be used with
confidence where ambient temperatures reaches in the neighborhood of 40oC, but are best used where
ambient temperatures are in the range of about 40oC.

C.2.4 Smoke Detectors

Three types of smoke detectors are commonly used. First type is actuated by absorption or scattering of visible
or near-visible light by combustion product and known as "optical detector". The second type is actuated by the

Part 4 4-67
Fire Protection

BNBC 2015 FINAL DRAFTPart 4
Fire Protection

production on ionization current within the detector and referred to as "ionization detector". The third type is
sensitive to carbon monoxide or other products of combustion and is known as "chemically sensitive detector".
In general, these should be used at places where ambient temperature varies between 0o to 35oC.
C.2.4.1 Optical smoke detectors
Invisible smoke from a clear burning shall not actuate such detectors. But they respond quickly where smoke is
optically dense and as such suitable for use in dust free clean atmosphere. Over a period of time, due to dust
and dirt, the sensitive surface of photo sensitive element and/or executor lamp of optical detectors may loss its
efficiency and as such optical detectors should be cleaned and maintained regularly.
C.2.4.2 Ionization chamber smoke detectors
These responds quickly to invisible smoke of clear burning, but may not respond to fire producing dense smoke.
These can be used in dust free, humidity controlled area. Smoke and other fumes, dust including slow
accumulated and disturbed aerial dust, fiber, steam and condensation produced by normal processes and
vehicle engines may cause false alarm. Warehouses exposed to fast air flows can also cause false alarm. Burning
of polyvinyl chloride will not sensitize the detector in time and may provide late warning or no warning at all.
C.2.4.3 Chemically sensitive smoke detectors
Chemically coated sensitive elements react to carbon monoxide or other products of combustion present in
smoke. Dust or moisture adversely affects the sensitive elements and are not very suitable for residential use.

C.3 SITING OF DETECTORS

Considering the prevailing weather condition of the occupancies and the problem of false alarm, the type of
detectors and the area of coverage shall be decided. Area of coverage of detectors is dependent on many
factors. The following aspects shall be taken into considerations in the design of detectors.

#######NEWPAGE
,• Various forms of overhead heating
• Exhaust air from air cooling equipment blowing out into the room or factory area
• Deep beams
• Roofs and ceiling of unusual shape
• Building with ground areas above 10 m and up to 30 m in height
• Staircases
• Canteen and Restaurants
• Plant Rooms
• Ambulant air currents
